# Notes from Q&A video

- Using latent space, and working through it, in order to try to work more with the intrinsic characteristics of the few images we have, otherwise scrape more images from the images or generate more information 

- If we encounter issues with photo size, we must use padding, cropping or resizing

- The main problem is specific: tattoos lack a lot of realism when they are the mean of generative AI
- Use hugging spaces?


# TODO

- First step we could augment the existing images by simple transformations like rotation and reflexion
- After that we feed those images into the Stable Diffusion model
